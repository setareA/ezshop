```
<The goal of this document is to analyse the structure of your project, compare it with the design delivered
on April 30, discuss whether the design could be improved>

# Summary analysis
```
<Discuss here main differences of the current structure of your project vs the design delivered on April 30>
<Discuss if the current structure shows weaknesses that should be fixed>
